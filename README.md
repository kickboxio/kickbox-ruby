# Email Verification Library for Ruby

Kickbox determines if an email address is not only valid, but associated with a actual user. Uses include:

* Preventing users from creating accounts on your applications using fake, misspelled, or throw-away email addresses.
* Reducing bounces by removing old, invalid, and low quality email addresses from your mailing lists.
* Saving money and projecting your reputation by only sending to real email users.

## Getting Started

To begin, hop over to [kickbox.io](http://kickbox.io) and create a free account. Once you've signed up and logged in, click on **API Settings** and then click **Add API Key**. Take note of the generated API Key - you'll need it to setup the client as explained below.

## Installation

Make sure you have [rubygems](https://rubygems.org) installed

```bash
$ gem install kickbox
```

#### Versions

Works with [ 1.8.6 / 1.8.7 / 1.9.1 / 1.9.2 / 1.9.3 / 2.0.0 / 2.1.0 / 2.1.1 ]

## Usage

```ruby
require "kickbox"

client   = Kickbox::Client.new('Your_API_Key_Here')
kickbox  = client.kickbox()
response = kickbox.verify("test@example.com")
```
#### Options

**timeout** `integer` (optional) - Maximum time, in milliseconds, for the API to complete a verification request. Default: 6000.

```ruby
# Example with options
response = kickbox.verify("test@example.com", { "timeout" => 60000 })
```

### Response information

- **result** `string` - The verification result: `deliverable`, `undeliverable`, `risky`, `unknown`
- **reason** `string` - The reason for the result. Possible reasons are:
  - `invalid_email` - Specified email is not a valid email address syntax
  - `invalid_domain` - Domain for email does not exist
  - `rejected_email` - Email address was rejected by the SMTP server, email address does not exist
  - `accepted_email` - Email address was accepted by the SMTP server
  - `low_quality` - Email addresshas quality issues that may make it a risky or low-value address
  - `low_deliverability` - Email address appears to be deliverable, but deliverability cannot be guaranteed
  - `no_connect` - Could not connect to SMTP server
  - `timeout` - SMTP session timed out
  - `invalid_smtp` - SMTP server returned an unexpected/invalid response
  - `unavailable_smtp` - SMTP server was unavailable to process our request
  - `unexpected_error` - An unexpected error has occurred
- **role**  `true | false` - *true* if the email address is a *role* address (`postmaster@example.com`, `support@example.com`, etc)
- **free**  `true | false` - *true* if the email address uses a free email service like gmail.com or yahoo.com.
- **disposable**  `true | false` - *true* if the email address uses a *disposable* domain like trashmail.com or mailinator.com.
- **accept_all**  `true | false` - *true* if the email was accepted, but the domain appears to accept all emails addressed to that domain.
- **did_you_mean** `null | string` - Returns a suggested email if a possible spelling error was detected. (`bill.lumbergh@gamil.com` -> `bill.lumbergh@gmail.com`)
- **sendex** `float` - A *quality* score of the provided email address ranging between 0 (no quality) and 1 (perfect quality). More information on the Sendex Score can be found [here](http://help.kickbox.io/support/solutions/articles/4000017047-the-sendex-).
- **email** `string` - Returns a normalized version of the provided email address. (`BoB@example.com` -> `bob@example.com`
